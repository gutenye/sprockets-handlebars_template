We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. 

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass with `rake test`.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

And in case we didn't emphasize it enough: we love tests!
